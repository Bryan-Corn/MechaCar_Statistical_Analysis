# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Module 15

# Overview

This project is a statistical analysis for AutosRUS. Linear Regression is used to predict MPG on prototype vehiles and determine what factors are most inportant in predicting the MPG. Summary descriptive statistics and T-tests are used to assess the manufacturing consistency of suspension coils. The final deliverable of this project is a suggested study to compare MechaCar with competitors.
